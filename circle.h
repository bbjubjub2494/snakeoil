    Parameters :    f_name -
                        Store memeber first name in specific Circle.

                    position_num -

    Structure :     circle

    Parameters :    circleName -
                        Store Circle name.

                    configPath -
                        Every circle has its own config file, so we need to
                        know where exactly this file is stored.

                    padsPath -
                        Every circle has its own Pad's folder, so we need to
                        know where exactly this folder is stored.

                    userKey -
                        Every circle has its own userkey file, so we need to
                        know where exactly this file is stored.
